# Creative Duality

This project is a personal portfolio website created by Prince Opoku Amaning and Akua Serwaa Dankwa as the final project for the ALX Software Engineering program. It serves as both a showcase of our React and frontend development skills and a personal space for displaying Prince’s photography and web design services.

# Project Overview
The website was designed to be dynamic, responsive, and engaging. It emphasizes a blend of creative design and technical skills with the following key features:

Interactive Gallery: A dynamic photo gallery that rearranges images randomly upon reload, ensuring a fresh experience every time.
Contact Form: Visitors can reach out for bookings, making it easy to engage with potential clients.
Smooth Animations: Built with Framer Motion to enhance user experience through eye-catching transitions.
